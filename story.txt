A breakthrough was made this year in UW Madison, Dr.Z actualized the application of a brain-machine interface
on a robot. Previously, a brain-machine interface is used to connect human brain to a machine such that human
can easily retrive info from the machine. But this time, the machine is sucessfully connected to human's brain. This is a life-changing innovation because this will allow the robot to understand a human's inner consciousness better. Robot X, the first robot to put into test, successfully interpret Dr.Z's inner delightness and represented it as a vivid laughter. Many are patrified with excitement, however, many see this as a threat and worry about the robots gaining control of human society.
